# Quantum TV Life: A Quantum-Emotional Toy Model for Dynamic Storytelling

This project is a **creative simulation** that combines principles of quantum mechanics with emotional modeling to produce a dynamic, participatory media experience.

## What is this?

**Quantum TV Life** is an experimental framework where:
- A viewer's "emotional state" is modeled as a quantum superposition across 10 basic emotions.
- Upon observing a TV show, their emotional state is measured—collapsing into one emotion (like a quantum measurement).
- The outcome of the show (which plot line the viewer sees) is **weighted by the full probability spectrum of their emotions**, not just the actualized emotion—mirroring quantum measurement's influence on physical reality.

Run the script, and you'll see the "reality" of the show change with each run, and with each observer.

## Features

- **QuantumHuman class** simulates a quantum system of emotions.
- Demonstrates quantum measurement collapse and the influence of probabilities.
- TV show *Life* with 10 possible plot lines, chosen in a quantumly personalized way.
- Demonstrates the participatory nature of quantum theory in a playful, narrative context.

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**
'''
pip install numpy scipy
'''

2. **Run the script:**
quantum_life.py

3. **Observe the output:**
- The script prints the initial emotional superposition, the (optional) randomly mixed state, the measured (collapsed) emotion, and the selected plot outcome.

4. **Rerun** to see how the outcome changes!

## Example Output
'''
Initial quantum superposition of viewer's emotions:
Joy : amplitude = +0.316+0.000j, pr = 0.100
Sadness : amplitude = +0.316+0.000j, pr = 0.100
...
After random emotional quantum operation:
Joy : amplitude = +0.084-0.078j, pr = 0.013
...
Measuring emotional state...
Your emotion upon observing 'Life' is: SADNESS
Probabilities that led to this outcome:
joy: 0.013
sadness: 0.279
anger: 0.133
...

------- TV Show 'Life' (Quantum Collapsed) -------
The show actualizes as: ANGER
You experience: Plot 3: Conflict escalates between rivals.
'''
## How Does It Work?

1. **QuantumHuman**: Models emotions as quantum superposition.
2. **Measurement**: Collapses to a definite emotion, but keeps all probabilities for plot selection.
3. **Plot Selection**: Probability-weighted according to your quantum state — your reality is truly participatory, and unique, for every observer.

## Ideas for Expansion

- Simulate **entanglement** (multiple viewers whose realities become coupled).
- Let emotional state **evolve over multiple episodes** (measurement feedback).
- Visualize the quantum probability distributions and plot outcomes.
- Replace random unitary with media events, narrative choices, or user input.
