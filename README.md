# Quantum TV Life: A Quantum-Emotional Toy Model for Dynamic Storytelling

This project is a **creative simulation** that combines principles of quantum mechanics with emotional modeling to produce a dynamic, participatory media experience.

## What is this?

**Quantum TV Life** is an experimental framework where:
- A viewer's "emotional state" is modeled as a quantum superposition across 10 basic emotions.
- Upon observing a TV show, their emotional state is measured—collapsing into one emotion (like a quantum measurement).
- The outcome of the show (which plot line the viewer sees) is **weighted by the full probability spectrum of their emotions**, not just the actualized emotion—mirroring quantum measurement's influence on physical reality.

Run the script, and you'll see the "reality" of the show change with each run, and with each observer.

## Features

- **QuantumHuman class** simulates a quantum system of emotions.
- Demonstrates quantum measurement collapse and the influence of probabilities.
- TV show *Life* with 10 possible plot lines, chosen in a quantumly personalized way.
- Demonstrates the participatory nature of quantum theory in a playful, narrative context.

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**
```
pip install numpy scipy
```

2. **Run the script:**
quantum_life.py

3. **Observe the output:**
- The script prints the initial emotional superposition, the (optional) randomly mixed state, the measured (collapsed) emotion, and the selected plot outcome.

4. **Rerun** to see how the outcome changes!

## Example Output
```
Initial quantum superposition of viewer's emotions:
Joy         : amplitude = +0.316+0.000j, pr = 0.100
Sadness     : amplitude = +0.316+0.000j, pr = 0.100
Anger       : amplitude = +0.316+0.000j, pr = 0.100
Fear        : amplitude = +0.316+0.000j, pr = 0.100
Disgust     : amplitude = +0.316+0.000j, pr = 0.100
Surprise    : amplitude = +0.316+0.000j, pr = 0.100
Trust       : amplitude = +0.316+0.000j, pr = 0.100
Anticipation: amplitude = +0.316+0.000j, pr = 0.100
Acceptance  : amplitude = +0.316+0.000j, pr = 0.100
Boredom     : amplitude = +0.316+0.000j, pr = 0.100

After random emotional quantum operation:
Joy         : amplitude = -0.253+0.345j, pr = 0.183
Sadness     : amplitude = -0.176+0.314j, pr = 0.130
Anger       : amplitude = -0.183+0.012j, pr = 0.034
Fear        : amplitude = +0.010+0.265j, pr = 0.070
Disgust     : amplitude = +0.225-0.068j, pr = 0.055
Surprise    : amplitude = -0.056-0.045j, pr = 0.005
Trust       : amplitude = +0.385+0.140j, pr = 0.168
Anticipation: amplitude = -0.288+0.082j, pr = 0.089
Acceptance  : amplitude = +0.350-0.077j, pr = 0.128
Boredom     : amplitude = +0.034-0.368j, pr = 0.137

Measuring emotional state...
Your emotion upon observing 'Life' is: **JOY**
Probabilities that led to this outcome:
  joy: 0.183
  sadness: 0.130
  anger: 0.034
  fear: 0.070
  disgust: 0.055
  surprise: 0.005
  trust: 0.168
  anticipation: 0.089
  acceptance: 0.128
  boredom: 0.137

------- TV Show 'Life' (Quantum Collapsed) -------
The show actualizes as: JOY
You experience: Plot 1: A joyous reunion changes everything.
```
## How Does It Work?

1. **QuantumHuman**: Models emotions as quantum superposition.
2. **Measurement**: Collapses to a definite emotion, but keeps all probabilities for plot selection.
3. **Plot Selection**: Probability-weighted according to your quantum state — your reality is truly participatory, and unique, for every observer.
